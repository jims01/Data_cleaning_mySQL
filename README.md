### Project Overview

This project analyzes global staff layoffs from 2020 to 2023 to provide insights into trends and patterns during this period. It focuses on identifying monthly and cumulative layoffs and ranking the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs in each year.

### Data cleaning 

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:

1. Created a staging dataset: Organized raw data for processing.
2. Removed duplicates: Ensured unique records in the dataset.
3. Standardized the data: Unified formatting for consistency.
4. Handled missing values: Populated null or blank values where necessary.
5. Dropped unnecessary columns: Focused only on relevant data fields.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Key questions addressed during the analysis include:

- What is the overall number of layoffs?
- How many companies shut down between 2020 and 2023?
- Which are the top 5 countries with the most layoffs in each year?
- What is the ranking of the top 5 companies with the most layoffs in each year?

### Data Analysis

```sql
with Country_year (Country, Years, Total_laid_off) as
(
select Country, year(`date`),sum(total_laid_off)
from layoffs_staging2
group by Country, year(`date`)
), Country_year_ranking as
(
select*, dense_rank() Over(Partition by years order by Total_laid_off desc) as ranking
from country_year
where years is not null)

Select*
From country_year_ranking
where ranking <= 5;
```
